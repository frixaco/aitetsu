## Implementation TODOs

### Immediate (This Week)

1. **Fix broken chat state**

   - Create `src/store/chat.tsx` with React Context
   - Define interfaces in `src/types.ts`
   - Connect Chat component to state

2. **Implement proper streaming**

   - Fix event handlers in PromptArea
   - Add visual streaming indicators
   - Handle tool execution states

3. **Basic error handling**
   - Add try/catch around API calls
   - Show error messages in UI
   - Graceful degradation

### Short Term (Next 2 Weeks)

1. **Add core tools**

   - `write_file` in Rust backend
   - `list_directory` in Rust backend
   - Tool result visualization

2. **Message persistence**

   - Local storage for conversations
   - Export/import functionality

3. **Project management**
   - Header shows current project
   - Project switching UI

### Medium Term (Next Month)

1. **Enhanced file system**

   - File tree browser
   - Content preview
   - Multi-file operations

2. **Configuration system**

   - Settings panel
   - Model selection
   - API key management

3. **Keyboard shortcuts**
   - Global shortcut system
   - Help documentation

## Technical Debt & Best Practices

### Code Quality

- [ ] Add proper TypeScript strict mode
- [ ] Implement error boundaries
- [ ] Add unit tests for core functions
- [ ] Set up proper linting rules

### Architecture

- [ ] Separate concerns (UI/Logic/State)
- [ ] Implement proper dependency injection
- [ ] Add configuration management
- [ ] Create reusable component library

### Performance

- [ ] Implement message virtualization for large chats
- [ ] Add debouncing to search inputs
- [ ] Optimize re-renders with React.memo
- [ ] Add lazy loading for components

### Security

- [ ] Validate all file paths in backend
- [ ] Sanitize markdown rendering
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Add input validation

## File Structure Goals

```
src/
├── components/          # Reusable UI components
│   ├── ui/             # Basic UI primitives
│   ├── chat/           # Chat-related components
│   └── file-browser/   # File system components
├── store/              # State management
│   ├── chat.tsx        # Chat state
│   ├── project.tsx     # Project state
│   └── settings.tsx    # App settings
├── types/              # TypeScript definitions
├── hooks/              # Custom React hooks
├── utils/              # Utility functions
└── styles/             # CSS/Tailwind styles
```

## Success Metrics

### Week 1

- [ ] Chat component displays messages without errors
- [ ] Streaming responses work in UI
- [ ] File picker functionality restored

### Week 2

- [ ] Can send messages and get responses
- [ ] Tool execution visible in UI
- [ ] Basic file operations working

### Week 4

- [ ] Conversation history persists
- [ ] Multiple tools available
- [ ] Project management working
- [ ] Basic settings interface

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

- **Complex state management**: Start simple with Context, upgrade to Redux if needed
- **Performance issues**: Implement virtualization early for large chats
- **Tool reliability**: Add comprehensive error handling and fallbacks

### Scope Risks

- **Feature creep**: Focus on core chat functionality first
- **Over-engineering**: Build minimum viable features, iterate based on usage
- **Time management**: Set clear weekly milestones and stick to them

## Dependencies Management

### Current Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Tauri APIs
- **Backend**: Rust, Tauri, reqwest, serde, nucleo-matcher
- **Styling**: Catppuccin theme, Tailwind Typography
- **Build**: Vite, Tauri CLI

### Avoid Adding

- Heavy state management libraries (start with Context)
- Complex UI component libraries (build custom with Tailwind)
- Unnecessary dependencies (evaluate each addition carefully)

---

**Next Action**: Start with fixing the Chat component state management issues.
