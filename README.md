## Version 1 - Agentic AI coding assistant made with Tauri

**Status**: abandoned
**Reasons**:

- I fully switched back to Neovim and prefer CLI/TUI over GUi as my coding assistant at the moment
- I already learned the architecture of agentic coding assistants by looking through source code of exisiing open-source tools
- For me to daily drive it, it will take significant effort since I'll have to catch up to existing tools (AmpCode, Opencode, Claude Code) that are far-advanced and high quality(?)

**Idea**: Most agentic AI assistants are either CLI or VS Code extensions. I just wanted to have it as separate GUI application

## Version 2 - Branching-focused AI chat app

**Status**: suspended
**Reasons**:

- Currently, trying to decide if's worth it or if i'm okay with existing solutions

**Idea**: Existing implementations of branching in AI chat apps are clunky and basic (e.g. t3.chat, Google AI Studio) which makes it hard to navigate and have clear picture when you are exploring and learning multiple related topics. "Branch-conversations" are represented as separate convesations in existing UIs which I consider low effort and don't like. I wanted to fix that by having some sort of canvas-like UI where it would be easier to navigate between branches, have an ability to view whole (branches + original) conversations in a tree like view. This would make greatly help for those who use UI for researching, learning and discussing.
