## TODO

- For seamless edit/view mode for cards I have following idea:
  - When input box, buttons are hovered, they work immediately and you can't dragging while pressing those
  - Everywhere else (e.g. messages, empty areas) are for dragging
- Collabsible responses
- Fix titlebar on macOS: https://v2.tauri.app/learn/window-customization/#macos-transparent-titlebar-with-custom-window-background-color

## Adding cards flow

- Ctrl + n
- A white rounded sheet appears from bottom and fills the screen
